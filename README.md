# Exercise: Components and props

## Description:

Build a simple "User Profile" application using React components and props. You'll need to create two components to complete this exercise:

1. **UserProfile**: This component will render a user's name and age. It should take two props:
   - `name`: A string representing the user's name.
   - `age`: A number representing the user's age.
2. **App**: This component will render the `UserProfile` component with some sample data.

## Here are the steps to complete this exercise:

1. Create a new file called `UserProfile.tsx` and define the `UserProfile` component.
2. Inside the `UserProfile` component, render the user's name and age (which should be passed in as props).
3. Inside the `App` component, define a `user` object with two properties: `name` and `age`.
4. Render the `UserProfile` component inside the `App` component, passing in the `user` object as props.
5. Make sure that the user's name and age are displayed correctly.
